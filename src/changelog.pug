    h2 2.4 — 2018-02-24
    h3 Common
    ul
      li Support for Trimps v4.7
      li Migrated everything from plain old HTML+CSS+JS to Pug+Stylus+Typescript. This shouldn’t change anything visible, but let me know if something breaks!
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li The default target zone is now based on your highest VM clear.
      li From z70 to z110, leftover He is now dumped in Bait.
      li On Metal² and Trapper², leftover He is now dumped in Moti and Moti II.
      li Bugfix: no longer crash when all the weights are 0.
      li Bugfix: no longer crash when fixed perks are too expensive.

    h2 2.3 — 2017-11-30
    h3 Common
    ul
      li Hybrid notation and extended Standard notation are now supported.
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li Map caches are now taken into account (this shifts the Motivation-Looting balance a bit).
      li New presets for the feats Nerfed and Tent City.
      li The Trapper² preset now recommends points in Bait when relevant, making it usable mid-game.
      li New warnings when using “respec” presets incorrectly.
    h3 zFarm
    ul
      li Stopped recommending BW farming (never worth more than a small map with a resource cache).
      li Started recommending Extra Zones maps (only if you can afford them)
      li Life and Obliterated challenges are now supported.
      li Hyperspeed II is now taken into account.
      li New warning against farming on even Lead zones.
      li Reworded some messages (hopefully they’re less confusing, now).
      li Base loot is now displayed as a percentage of world-level loot.
      li New auto-filled input: “Fragments”
      li The auto-filled input “Challenge health” now uses multipliers instead of percentages (to avoid displaying Obliterated as +99999999999900%).
      li Auto-filled inputs “Agility” and “Hyperspeed” were merged into “Attack speed”.
      li Auto-filled inputs for the 3 nature empowerments were replaced by a single input for the currently active nature.
      li Bugfix: enemy health is now counted correctly on Lead and Coordinate.

    h2 2.2.1
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li “Target Zone” is now saved, like the other inputs.
      li More accurate valuation of Pheromones and Bait pre-z70.
      li New Overkill valuation.
      li The Scientist preset now fixes Coord=0.
      li Bugfix: stop assuming block pierce pre-z60.
      li Bugfix: don’t crash when a 0 He save is pasted.
    h3 zFarm
    ul
      li Spire II+ handling.
      li Bugfix: account for the magmamancermancy cap.
      li Bugfix: no longer consider multiple natures to be active at the same.
      li Bugfix: switching between trapper² and metal² presets no longer messes advanced options.
      li Bugfix: trimp² preset was overvaluing population.

    h2 2.2 — 2017-10-10
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li Lots of new presets!
      li Stopped suggesting removing points from perks if no respec is available.
      li Removed “Weight: Overkill”. This is now set automatically. You can still override it by adding OK to your “Fixed perks”.
      li An appropriate preset is now selected automatically when a save is pasted and no weights have ever been set manually.
      li Better display on small screens.
    h3 zFarm
    ul
      li Removed the misleading “highest zone where you one-shot everything” message.

    h2 2.1 — 2017-10-05
    h3 Common
    ul
      li Small graphical changes.
      li Toggling manual inputs now works using cookies, instead of adding #[tt #advanced] to the URL.
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li Helium left over is now displayed.
      li Added a “More Info” toggle, to display the cost and total spent on each perk.
      li Added a “Share” button.
      li “Fixed perks” can now be used to set maximums/minimums for perks, by using #[tt <] and #[tt >] instead of #[tt =].
      li Bugfix: fixing a perk to 0 now works correctly.
      li Bugfix: income was slightly overvalued late-game due to a math mistake.
      li Bugfix: selecting the Spire preset then another one no longer messes up your options.
      li Bugfix: extremely high helium no longer causes “Health is Infinity” errors (tested up to 1e100 He).
      li Bugfix: compatibility with the Pale Moon browser.

    h2 2.0 — 2017-09-30
    h3 Common
    ul
      li Added a changelog! Sorry for not doing that sooner.
      li Scientific, engineering and alphabetic notations are now supported.
      li Unexpected errors are now reported prominently, instead of silently displaying bogus results.
      li Renamed “advanced options” to “manual input”. Everything in there is auto-filled when pasting a save.
    h3 Perky
    ul
      li Generated housing estimation is now based on target zone instead of HZE (fixes #[a(href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Trimps/comments/739znc/using_the_dimensional_generator_makes_perky_want/') this bug]).
      li Generated housing estimation is now much more accurate for late-game.
      li Fixed a bug where the Spire preset would still recommend Looting and Resourceful.
      li Improved the algorithm to limit over-spending on low-impact perks (Resourceful, Pheromones).
      li Removed “Round Spire perks”. Rounding is now done automatically, so that perk levels always fit in 3 digits.
      li Removed “Devalue income”. Perky now estimates how many equipment levels will be affordable and values income accordingly.
      li Moved “Fixed perks” from the advanced options to the main options.
      li “Fixed perks” now accepts abbreviated perk names, such as P2, looty II, OK, resi, and many others.
      li Added two auto-filled inputs: “Production mod” and “Loot mod”. For metal² and trapper², Production mod should be set to 0.
